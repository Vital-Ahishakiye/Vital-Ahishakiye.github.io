  <!-- Description -->
  <p>
    In January 2024, UNICEF reported that a significant number of Rwandan children complete primary 
    education without solid foundational skills. Specifically, 33% of Primary 3 class students are unable 
    to read and understand a grade-level text in Kinyarwanda, and nearly 90% are unable to do so in 
    English, the official language of instruction. This issue is rooted in early childhood education 
    challenges. <em>UNICEF</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    Analyzing census data and information on Rwandan schools, I assessed the student-to-school ratio 
    across the country's 416 sectors. The findings revealed that 298 sectors lack any early childhood 
    education facilities, and 4 sectors have no primary schools, indicating that approximately 71% of 
    sectors are without early childhood education infrastructure.
  </p>
  <p>
    Overcrowding is a significant concern in primary schools, with 36% of sectors having an average 
    of 1,500 students per school. Given that 40% of Rwanda's population is under 15 years old, 
    overcrowding and limited accessibility to primary and pre-primary education remain pressing 
    issues. Addressing these challenges is crucial for the country's future, as quality education is 
    a key contributor to employment and overall development. <em>GOV.UK ASSETS</em>
