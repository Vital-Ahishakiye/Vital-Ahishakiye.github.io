Hello everyone! My name is Vital Ahishakiye, and I am currently pursuing a Master's of Science in Electrical and Computer Engineering with a specialization in Applied Machine Learning at Carnegie Mellon University Africa.

Data science has not only shaped my career trajectory but has also empowered me to make informed decisions in both my professional and personal life. One notable example is how I utilized data analysis techniques to successfully overcome a betting habit, an experience I share in detail in  ["My Unforeseen Journey into Data"](https://github.com/Vital-Ahishakiye/My-Unforeseen-Journey-into-Data/blob/main/full-story.md).

In addition to my academic pursuits, I am dedicated to continuously enhancing my skills through various avenues. I am presently enrolled in the Google Advanced Data Analytics course, aiming to consolidate and strengthen the diverse skills I have acquired through my coursework. Furthermore, I have actively engaged in practical applications of my knowledge by participating in Kaggle competitions such as the Titanic shipwreck and credit card challenges.

I am passionate about leveraging data science to drive positive change and innovation, and I look forward to contributing meaningfully to this dynamic field.
