Hi everyone! My name is Nathan Quarterer and I'm Education Director at Earth Lab and the Environmental Data Science Innovation & Inclusion Lab (ESITL) at the University of Colorado Boulder.

Prior to my roles here at Earth Lab and ESITL, I spent 10 years teaching physics, math, and environmental science at Northeast Iowa Community College. I did my PhD in Teaching & Learning (Science Education) at the University of Iowa where I studied how 8th graders come to know about climate change.

Since coming to CU as a postdoc in 2020, I was involved with the Earth Data Science Corps (EDSC) program where I served as lead instructor. I'm now overseeing the ESITL Stars internship, modeled after the ESDC, and the ESITL Data Short Course.
